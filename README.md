# MYOWN_RTOS
MYRTOS - Real-Time Operating System for Cortex-M3

MyRTOS is a lightweight, real-time operating system designed specifically for ARM Cortex M3 microcontrollers. It prioritizes efficiency and performance, offering a robust set of features to streamline embedded systems development.

Features
Preemptive Priority Round-Robin Scheduling

Ensures fair and responsive task execution based on priority levels.
Task Management

Simplifies the creation, activation, and termination of tasks in your applications.
Timing Control

Supports precise time-based delays for tasks.
Optimized Context Switching

Achieves a context switch time of 42 microseconds, minimizing latency and optimizing interrupt handling.
Power Efficiency

Automatically enters sleep mode when the system is idle, enhancing energy efficiency.
Semaphore Synchronization

Provides efficient task synchronization with built-in support for handling priority inversion (priority ceilling method).
Overview
MyRTOS is built on a deep understanding of ARM architecture, including assembly language, access levels, MSP and PSP management, and advanced interrupt handling. It is a powerful and efficient tool for embedded systems development.
